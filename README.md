# bubbleSort
```
constand MAX is max length of array
function sort (array):
  create integer variables i and j
  for j from zero to MAX - 1:
    if array[j] with array [j+1]
      swap array[j] with array[j+1]
      printArray(array)

Code should be able to sort the numbers (1-9) correctly while also printing out an array after every run through.
```
